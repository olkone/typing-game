# Speed Typing Game

## Overview
This is a simple text-based typing game created with Python 3 that is playable in your terminal. 


The goal of the game is to quickly and accurately type the randomly generated phrase. The program keeps track of your time and scores, and gives you instantateous feedback of your words per minute (wpm).


This game is my first fully independent coding project--no tutorials whatsoever! It is also my first step away from using Jupyter Notebook, which I was using heavily in the learning process.
